# kOffice
* The Modern, Editable, Plug-in Ready and Open Source Text Processor 

I hope to have a base version done by early 2022, including file, font, print and layout function. Support for docx files 
  included, as well as the native file type for kOffice, .kcl files. 
  
 * The goal is to have a vast amount of plug-ins for themeing, ai utilities, extra options and cloud support options. 
 
 * Feature list for roadmap will be posted after base version is released early 2022
